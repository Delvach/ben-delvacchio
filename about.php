        <h3>History</h3>
        
        <p>Ben was born in Broomall, PA in 1974.</p>
        
        <p>He spent four years involved in Video Crew and Stage Crew while at
        Marple Newtown Senior High in Newtown Square, PA.  Graduating in 1993, Ben then began 
        studying for a degree in Telecommunications at Kutztown University in Kutztown, PA.</p>
        
        <p>While at Kutztown, he taught himself how to code in HTML, JavaScript, and work with
        graphics using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.  Switching majors to English with a focus
        in journalism, he became heavily involved with The Keystone Newspaper, KU's student newspaper.</p>
        
        <p>Ben graduated from Kutztown in 1998 with a Bachelor's degree in English, Professional Writing
        with a minor in Public Relations.</p>
        
        <p>In 2000 he moved to Mechanicsburg, PA to work for a small software start-up company called
        CommNav, Inc.  He learned PHP and contributed to developing and providing graphics support for
        the company's web application products.</p>
        
        <p>In 2004 CommNav was dissolved into its parent company, Perfect Order, which was later
        re-named to Versatile Systems.  Ben transitioned to the position of Consultant and began
        working for Comcast, Inc. in Philadelphia.  The organization he worked for later became
        known as Comcast Interactive Media, and while there he was involved in numerous customer-facing
        web projects, the most notable of which was, 'TV Planner', a prototype AJAX application
        for which he was the principle programmer.  In 2005 he was hired as a full-time Comcast
        employee and spent the next several years involved in various aspects of content and functionality
        for comcast.net.</p>
        
        <p>Currently living in the Audubon/Oaks area of Pennsylvania, Ben enjoys cycling the local
        trails and more recently, kayaking the local waterways.  A 2009 beginner's course in Arduino was his
        introduction to amateur electronics, and he has enjoyed expanding his ability to program
        the physical world ever since.</p>

        <h3>About This Site</h3>
        
        <p>This site is in the process of being developed from scratch.  It is intended to be a platform
        with which to demonstrate my abilities as a web developer, and to provde me a scratchbox
        where I can experiment with various projects.</p>
        
        <p>It uses just enough PHP to provide consistency among the current pages and allow for some
        scalability.  Some data (currently only navigation) is stored as .xml and parsed via the xml2json 
        extension for jQuery.</p>
        
        <p>The current infrastructure is designed to be simple, as my current focus is honing my
        HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery skills.</p>
