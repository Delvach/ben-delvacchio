        <p>Hello!  This is my portfolio and personal <abbr title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTML</abbr>,
        JavaScript and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> sketchbook.</p>
        
        <p>I'm currently in the process of assembling a basic framework for this site, putting together
        some actual content, and dabbling with a few projects.  The back-end, appearance, content and
        any functionality are all being developed concurrently so please forgive any browser-specific
        glitches you may encounter.  I haven't spent much time working on anything approaching a 'real' design
        yet, as I'm more focused on developing decent semantic HTML first.</p>
        
        <p>I'll be implementing a solution for contacting me on here, but for now you can
        find me on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/delvach/">Facebook</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Since this site <em>is</em> portfolio material, feel free to follow its progress on my
        public <a href="https://github.com/Delvach/ben-delvacchio">github repository</a>!</p>
