<h1>Ben Del Vacchio</h1>
<p>Hello!  This is a personal website where I can practice being a developer while I look for a job near where I live.</p>

<p>The first thing I'm going to do is document the process of setting up this site.
First I log into the domain administration tool for 1and1, my hosting provider.  
I create a new 'ben' subdomain for an existing 'delvacchio.com' domain (which currently redirects to my brother's landscaping & garden center website).
Next we pull up our old friend Transmit and create an 'index.html' file and an empty style sheet and a very basic website upon which to build more.
We take a screenshot of this version and upload it to the 'images' directory.
</p>

<p>
Since I've used CVS and Subversion to collaborate on projects in the past, I'm going to save myself a lot of potential future grief by planning on this site expanding beyond my current plans by incorporating version control at the beginning.
The current preferred solution is 'git', so I'll be using 'github' to manage my code.
</p>

<p>And if this is visible, then it's working!  Yup.  That's a good feeling.  So what we're doing is editing files locally, committing them to github, and pulling them down onto the server.
That may seem excessive for a site that currently has 11 files, and does mean I need to spend about 20 minutes setting up Apache locally if I decide to use PHP for a back-end.  It also means I can track past revision online in my <a href="https://github.com/Delvach/ben-delvacchio">github repository</a>.</p>
